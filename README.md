# Election Booth

This is a small project to emulate a very low-level voting system

Features ðŸ”¥
- Type END to display all votes
- Type CORRUPT to add 100,000 votes to the candidate of your choice
- User validation and sanitation to ensure no errors
- At the end there is a prompt asking the user if they would like to go again
- try except and finally loop ensures that there will be no RuntimeErrors and that Keyboard Interrupts are handled correctly
